    % Autoformatter (black/isort) implementation - shouldn't have even been a big project in 2020, skip
    % can I give metrics here? Didn't save real ones with numbers :(
    %.     - Salespeople use asset reporting for demos because it's so polished, even if it's not relevant to the customer lol
    %.     - analytics integration was the "smoothest project JSQ has ever had" -Xanthe (first project I solo led :100:)

     performance of many pages by 90\%+ through backend/query optimizations
     % this bullet has way too many words, but I'm fighting to stay in a single page
     % perf improvements - maybe remove?
     % zero-downtime vs rolling/downgradeable deployments, focus on DB schema consolidation project
     % 
    \item
    Recognized as a technical and thought leader. Promoted best practices and higher \\
    engineering standards, performed design reviews across teams, and mentored colleagues
    % Cross-environment DB schema consolidation project - how do I succinctly describe this in a way that it's meaningful?
    % idk how to talk about how I became the go-to person for "we can't figure out how this happens", or ensuring that other engineers aren't blocked
   % Anything to include here about strong relationships with PMs? was I the only engineering IC to actually engage with every other IC?
